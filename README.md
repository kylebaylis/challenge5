# challenge5

A simple work day task scheduler. Each time block will change color depending on the time. If the tme has passed, it will be grey, if it is the current hour, it will be red, and if it is in the future, it will be green. You can enter text in the text area, and save it. If you refresh the page, it will still be there because it saves to your browser's local storage.

To test the time function, take this code in line 5: .subtract(2, "hours") and place it after moment(). Change the 2 to different values accordingly.
